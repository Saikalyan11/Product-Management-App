## **Product Management App Console Output**

- Designed a product management application using java.
- Where we can Add products, Get those added Products and Search products by their names.
  

## **Getting Started**

It’s all Done by **JAVA** so there's nothing much to have in your 🖥️**System**, only the **_JAVA JDK_** is fine to work with.
And **code** will come in handy. Once you open **your IDE** it will be easy to access

## **Pre-requisites**

- You can use your **notepad** which is already in your 🖥️**System**.
- It’s better 😌 to use **IDE,** this **IDE** gives some shortcuts while writing code.
- I prefer to use **VS Code** because it is used for all programming languages. But most of them use different **_IDE_** for different languages. If you want to work only with **Java** it’s better to use **_Eclipse_** and **_IntelliJ,_** these will provide more faster process speed towards **Java** because they are used to work only on **Java.**
